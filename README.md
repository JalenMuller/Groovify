<h1>Groovify</h1>

<p>Groovify is a music platform where anyone can sign up to listen to music or to share their own music. It works similarly to something like soundcloud with a UI that's more like Spotify.</p>

<p>Users can upload singles or albums. This music can then be listened to by anyone and playlists can be made with it. The backend API is served with Laravel in PHP and the frontend UI is made with React/TypeScript.</p>

<p>The project is hosted at <a href="https://groovify.jalenmuller.com">groovify.jalenmuller.com</a>.</p>

<b>I don't own the license to any songs uploaded and this shouldn't be used as an actual music platform!</b>
